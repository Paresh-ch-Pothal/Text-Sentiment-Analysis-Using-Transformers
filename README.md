# Text-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Transformers
### 📝 Project Overview
This project is a Text Sentiment Analysis system built using the lightweight transformer model prajjwal1/bert-tiny. The model is fine-tuned to classify text into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. Due to its small size, it is highly efficient and well-suited for quick inference on limited-resource environments. The training was performed using TensorFlow and evaluated with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The final model is deployed using Gradio for easy web-based interaction, allowing users to test sentiment predictions in real time.

### 🚀 Technologies Used
TensorFlow / Keras
Hugging Face Transformers (bert-tiny)
